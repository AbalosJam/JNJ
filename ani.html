      <h3>Dear Joe,</h3>
      <p>Congratulations! You managed to survive a relationship with me for another year. This year was definitely a rough one for our relationship. I'm just a little surprised that we're still together even after all the arguments we had. I guess no matter the reason we fight, we will always end up forgiving each other just because our love is stronger than what an argument could break.</p>

      <p>To be honest I've become insecure about your love for me. My heart broke a bit when you told me you no longer love me as much as you did before. This just stuck on to me and it really sucks because I get pretty depressed every time I remind myself about this. It got so bad that I started constantly debating breaking up with you, convincing myself that you don't actually love me anymore. However, I always think back at the reasons why I love you and get a grasp back to the fact I trust your heart and I trust that you still actually love me. I'm sorry that I started doubting your love but I can't really help it since hearing it directly from you really hurt me a lot, I fear that your love for me may have gotten weaker and I'm no longer as special to you anymore.</p>

      <p>For now I'm holding on to the hope that you'll somehow fall in love with me again with all the sparks and whatever <i>magic</i> you felt when we first got together when we finally see each other face to face. This hope honestly scares me because there's always the <i>what if he doesn't?</i> Of course I probably blew up the situation more than how it is and this is all probably just needless worrying from me but I guess this just shows how important all your love is to me.</p>

      <p>Even with all of these conflicting emotions going on with me it still doesn't shake the fact that I still love you even though you're a big jerk sometimes. These emotions are also what probably started my <i>PMS-ing.</i></p>

      <p>I don't know how it is with you anymore but you're still the first thing I think about when I wake up every morning. I'm still always thinking about you no matter what my mood is or what I'm doing. I still love your presence even if you don't say anything in Skype. I still love how crazy and weird you are around me. I love all the texts you send me while you're at work and on your breaks. I still love that you stream your games just for me. I still get a little flustered when ever you hit on me or want to get it on. I still love learning new things about you. I still get horny from time to time just by thinking about you. I still won't tell you when that happens though because it's embarrassing. I still love staring at your face whenever I get the chance to. I still love hearing you laugh. I still love seeing your smile. I still love every single kiss you give me even though you don't give them out as much as you did before. I still see you as the man I'll be in love with through thick and thin. And I still wish I could always keep you happy even though I may not know what I'm doing and end up frustrating you instead. Sometimes I wonder if you even deserve this much love from me. <_< jk.</p>
      
      <p>There's a quote that says that "Good relationships don't just happen. They take time, patience, and two people who will work to be together." The fact that our goal of being together is still the same makes me feel pretty good about us and that we can make it happen since it's something both of us really want to achieve. You're my first love bby and hopefully I'll be your last, let's make it so that it's the best we've ever had. Cuz baby you're my errthang, you're all I've ever wanted...</p>

      <p>Anyways, thank you for giving me your love for another year. Thank you for putting up with me no matter how much I may frustrate you. Thank you for all the good,bad, happy, sad, fun, romantic, and sexy memories you have given me. Thank you for calming me down with your presence when I can't sleep. Thank you for making me smile with all your silliness. Thank you for making me feel sexy naked even though I'm not fit at all. Thank you for planning our future together and wanting a kid with me even if it may seem so far away. And most of all, thank you for still wanting to be with me even though we're so far away from each other.</p>

      <p>Happy Anniversary my love, I can't wait to finally see you face to face, hold you, kiss you, and...other things...in the future...;)</p>

      <p>...and yes, you are a princess if you want to.</p>
