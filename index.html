      <h1>Dear Joe,</h1>
      <p>
        It has officially been a year since we became lovers, however, it really doesn't feel all that long ago. I can still remember how tired I was talking all night with you, how heavy your words felt when you told me your feelings, and how fast my heart raced for almost the whole day afterwards. I really didn't get any sleep that day. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I would have to admit that this relationship isn't all so easy; distance being one of the most obvious factors among other barriers. We've discussed this various times before, but even still we managed to keep a firm grasp on to hoping that we will eventually end up together. I guess it means that you gave up on searching for other girls and had to settle with me right? [I'm jk, I hope this isn't your reason you butt! >=o]
      </p>
      <p>
        As you know you are my first love, I'll admit you're probably not the best lover out there since you're really selfish and don't really know how to handle women, but none the less I fell in love with everything you are. Within this year you've made me experience many firsts, you've made me grow from every little argument and quarrels we fought and concluded, and you've made me learn so much about myself that I haven't known before. [If you know what I mean ;D]
      </p>
      <p>
        Baby I want to be with you, I want us to be happy, I want our relationship to flourish, I want to make us happen, so don't give up. I know you've been through a lot, and I know sometimes you think you're a disappointment and even a failure because of your past, but to me, you are the best and even if you are able to change your past, I really do hope that you'd still play SK and meet me too. I also know that when you want something, you try every random shizz you can do to get it, now just apply that to real life, but let's be real baby, staring at something for days won't do anything! lol.
      </p>

        Thank you for loving me for who I am, knowing that you would still love me if I get fat, go bald and wear a wig, and even turn into a zombie makes me happy.Thank you for putting up with all my complaints, my indecisiveness, my harsh honesty, and my unwillingness to show you my peach. Thank you for just being there to listen to my worries, to always trying to make me laugh, and trying to just be with me. Thank you for all the love that you gave me this year and I hope to receive more for the years to come.
      </p>

        Happy Anniversary my love. This year was fun and definitely very sexual, I hope to make more memories with you whether good, bad, or sexy, I'll be fine as long as it's with you.
      </p>
